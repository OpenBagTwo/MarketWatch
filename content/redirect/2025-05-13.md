    Capital One Stock zooms as The assisted dying lobby isn’t being honest with you
summary: >
    © The Guardian—You’ve been deceived by the campaign for assisted dying. It has told you who the proposed law is for: people on their metaphorical deathbeds, no hope in sight, desperate to spare themselves and their loved ones the experience of an agonising death. And no wonder – these cases obviously merit sympathy and concern.
