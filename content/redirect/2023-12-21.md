summary: >
    © The Guardian—When I was young we had a Christmas stocking with the dog’s name on it, inked on to the white trim with a laundry pen. On Christmas morning it would be found to contain two or perhaps three treats picked up from the pet aisle of the supermarket: nothing festive, everything edible. The dog, as I recall, was appreciative, if a little suspicious.
