    S&P 500 in free fall as Amid post-party hangover and pancake hell at least it’s spring
summary: >
    © The Guardian—I went out on Friday night, to a beloved friend’s 50th birthday party, and I think it is going to be the last time I do. Nearly 72 hours later I still have a hangover. I’m exhausted, look like death and everything hurts. And the thing is, I wasn’t even drinking. I had two Cokes. It’s now the going out and meeting people – even people I want to meet! People I know and really, really like! – after 7pm that almost kills me. All the standing up when my body is expecting a sofa. All the not being at home. All the not knowing quite where the loo is. All the not being in stained clothes and slippers. All the having to get home afterwards. I cannot, not any more.
