    © The Guardian—Throughout the World Cup pool stages, Ireland’s ruthless edge in attack has impressed me but it was their defensive resilience against Scotland which really caught my eye. The match was set up for them - all the pressure was on Scotland - but their execution on both sides of the ball was spot-on and that is a hallmark of Andy Farrell’s side.
