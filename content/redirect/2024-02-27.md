    S&P 500 shoots up as The British seaside is full of charm
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Last week, I ventured to Southend-on-Sea with my partner. Rather than spending a rare day off together sitting in front of Netflix, we decided it would be much more enjoyable to see a bit of the British coastline, in all of its grey, tacky glory. It will be fun, we told each other. It will be nice to see the sea.
