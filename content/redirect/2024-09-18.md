    Nikkei dives as Please Do Not Touch review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—‘Please do not touch” reads a sign in front of a stolen Somali afro comb on display in a British heritage site. But why should we listen when it has been placed here by thieving hands? Mason, a social justice TikToker, is here to expose the artefact’s hidden colonial history to the world. But, when he gets caught veering a little too close to the comb, a tragic chain reaction is forced into motion. Mason is locked away from his friends and family in a young offender institution, his voice effectively silenced in the process.
