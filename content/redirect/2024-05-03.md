    S&P 500 catapults as ‘Every 20 minutes there’s something that would be another play’s finale’
summary: >
    © The Guardian—The dragon stirs to life as Toby Olié plucks it up by its tail. He spirals it&nbsp;through the air and, quick as ripping off a plaster, tears the creature in two. “Even when he&nbsp;was curled up on the floor,” the puppet designer says, undoing another of the dragon’s joints, “he took up too much space.” Olié sticks the body back together, a little shorter but more malleable now, and the tail wriggles back into being.
