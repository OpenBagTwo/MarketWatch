    Capital One Stock in free fall as ‘It was strange
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Iranian photographer Mohammad Nazari was&nbsp;in a bus station when he took this shot. “I was just leaving a&nbsp;religious ceremony in&nbsp;Zanjan, which is near&nbsp;the capital of Tehran, when I&nbsp;happened upon this scene completely&nbsp;by&nbsp;chance,” he says. “The glass of the&nbsp;bus station separated&nbsp;these two&nbsp;young girls – one&nbsp;with her hand outstretched and placed on the glass, the other turning to look at her. The presence of a girl without a hijab in a&nbsp;crowd at an ancient religious ceremony created an interesting contrast. The feeling I&nbsp;get from this photo is&nbsp;very strange.”
