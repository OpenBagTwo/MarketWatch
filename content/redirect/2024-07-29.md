    S&P 500 tumbles as A Morrissey tribute band separates the art from the artist
summary: >
    © The Guardian—On Saturday night, I went to the Dublin Castle, a pub and music venue in Camden, north London, the fabled birthplace of Britpop. I definitely wasn’t there when Blur were born; I feel sure I would have remembered. But I was there the night a guy set his hair on fire because he was trying to make a girl smell his shampoo and he accidentally leaned over someone lighting a cigarette. So that’s going back a few years.
