    Dow jumps as Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Italian neorealism of the 1950s and 60s lurks behind Damiano Michieletto’s 2015 Covent Garden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/04/cavalleria-rusticana-pagliacci-review-royal-opera-house-london">staging of Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci</a>, now on its third revival, overseen by Noa Naamat and conducted by Daniel Oren. It remains a compelling piece of theatre, subtle in its attention to psychological detail, compassionate, and admirably avoids melodrama in its exploration of emotional extremes.
