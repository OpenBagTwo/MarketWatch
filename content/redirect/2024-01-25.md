    Nikkei zooms as Northanger Abbey review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Jane Austen’s slim oeuvre has an odd place in the literary and filmic canon: readers tend to fall passionately in love with it when they are too young to understand how barbed and ambivalent its worldview is beneath the sprigged muslin. So it is both fun and appropriate to see her early novel given a fanfic makeover by Zoe Cooper of the sort that has previously seen Harry Potter copping off with Ron Weasley. Janeites, be warned.
