    Capital One Stock scrambling as ‘If you get it wrong, it’s sacrilegious!’ TV’s problem with Irish accents
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Putting on a good Irish accent is an art. In the same way that pouring Guinness is an art, actually. And as with all artistic feats, people think, “Well, anyone could do that!” before swiftly finding out that anyone could not, in fact, do that. An accurate Irish accent, for a non-Irish actor, takes dedication, research, talent. And as is the case with all art, failure invites utter brutality from the critics.
