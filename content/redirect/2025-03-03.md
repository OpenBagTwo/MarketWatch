    Dow dives as Hakeem review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—So many music documentaries have a kind of faked intimacy; they dangle the promise of lifting the lid on a star’s darkest secrets but end up feeling more like propaganda. You can’t say that about this film featuring the London singer-songwriter Hak Baker. What you see is what you get with him and, like him, the documentary feels genuine and very likable. It was filmed over five years by James Topley and Ivo Beckett (working together as Deadhorses). The pair must be mates with Baker, going by the number of shots of him at his kitchen table, beer in hand, or lugging a sofa down stairs as he is evicted from yet another flat, face fixed with a smile that could raise the room temperature by at least five degrees.
