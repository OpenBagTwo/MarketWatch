    FTSE goes wild as Lock up your TV remote! Why Jilly Cooper’s Rivals was guaranteed to be joyous television
summary: >
    © The Guardian—It begins, of course, with bonking. A closeup on a bare male bottom, thrusting energetically in a Concorde loo. Cries of ecstasy float over a soundtrack of Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love as the plane hits supersonic and the flight attendant pops the champagne. It can only be Jilly Cooper, and that bottom can only be Rupert Campbell-Black – champion show jumper, international heart-throb, Tory sports minister, braying toff, absolute shit. Lock up your telly remote, because Rivals – that most gloriously 1980s piece of doorstopper fiction, Blighty’s answer to Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities – has landed on our screens.
