    FTSE dives as The Lehman Trilogy helped me to live with my sight loss
summary: >
    © The Guardian—I began to notice my sight deteriorating in my 40s, but not just in the way that you expect it to with age. I had night blindness and blind spots in my field of view. At 44, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a&nbsp;genetic eye condition that causes the retina cells to die. I had always been a&nbsp;very visually oriented person: I was a practising architect, and someone who loved to read, draw, go to the cinema and visit art exhibitions. So when black text disappeared on a glaring white page, films became impossible to follow and artworks only took shape once explained to me, I questioned who I would be without my vision.
