title: Nikkei tumbles as Last time I took a plane, my toddler threatened to vomit all over it. So, yes, I’m in favour of child-free flights
summary: © The Guardian—Sorry to break it to all the other parents out there, but my toddler is, objectively speaking, the cutest child in the world. She is an absolute cherub, a delight and a privilege to be around – especially in the economy-minus-class cabin of a cramped transatlantic flight when she is belting out Twinkle Twinkle Little Star at the top of her lungs for the fourth time in a row while everyone else is trying to get some sleep.
