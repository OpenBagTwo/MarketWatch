    S&P 500 in free fall as The Damned review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Every film ought to have a signature image, and slow-burn supernatural chiller The Damned has a doozy: a body washed ashore shows unexpected signs of life, a stirring in the midsection … but surprise, slash the bloated stomach open and there’s an eel in there, wriggling about and presumably feasting on guts. Unfortunately nothing else provides quite so fulsomely gothic a moment, which is a shame, because it’s an arresting flourish.
