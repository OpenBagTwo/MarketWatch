    Capital One Stock scrambling as can Harrow sell an elitist British boarding school fantasy to New Yorkers?
summary: >
    © The Guardian—This fall, the British boarding school Harrow will open its first offshoot in the US: a lush 170-acre waterfront campus in Long Island. For 0.2 full rides to Harvard a year, parents can wave away their children to the prestigiously named school, renowned for its centuries-old traditions (such as calling teachers “beaks” and bad behaviour “skew”). Classes will take place in the Bourne mansion, the opulent former home of a wealthy American businessman, around which modern facilities will be built.
