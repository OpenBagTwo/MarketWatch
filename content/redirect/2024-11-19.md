    S&P 500 skyrockets as Stay With Me by Hanne Ørstavik review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Stay With Me is a brief novel, but the whole is overshadowed by fear. The narrator, a Norwegian novelist living in Milan, recalls her childhood in the book’s opening pages, the constant threat of her father’s violence, its eruptions the more fearsome for being random, unpredictable. “The world was hard. Wrong was wrong. When it could have&nbsp;been right. Afraid was a state of being. I don’t know when it started. All&nbsp;I know is that I was afraid, afraid was a skin beneath my skin that couldn’t be shed.”
