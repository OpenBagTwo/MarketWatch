    Dow plummets as People’s behaviour at music gigs is getting worse. I have three rules to solve that
summary: >
    Earlier this week, Lucy May Walker, a singer-songwriter from Redditch, posted a series of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cw0k36y8j2po">modest proposals for behaviour at concerts</a> under the title Gig Etiquette. The four subheadings for her guidelines were: 1. Don’t Talk During the Show; 2. Be in the Moment; 3. The Audience Have Not Paid to See You; and 4. Have An Amazing Time. The former busker, who had hitherto received a relatively low level of attention despite being championed by Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine, suddenly found herself at the centre of what would, until recently, have been called a Twitterstorm.
