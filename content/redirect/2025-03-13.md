    Dow in free fall as You’re Embarrassing Yourself by Desiree Akhavan audiobook review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—A funny, candid and often heartbreaking essay collection, You’re Embarrassing Yourself documents mortifying episodes in the life of Iranian-American film-maker and actor Desiree Akhavan’s life, dating back to childhood when she was voted the ugliest girl in her school. Her book is partly a letter to her younger self, whom she reassures that her face and body “will settle into something you’ll be able to live with by the time you’re 30”, and a paean to readers who “clutch the moniker ‘loser’ close to [their] heart. At first, it’ll feel like a handicap, but eventually it’ll transform into a superpower, because being on the outside offers up the best vantage point from which to observe and skewer.”
