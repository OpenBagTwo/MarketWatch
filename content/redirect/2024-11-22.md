    Dow soars as Saving Santa’s Sleigh review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—A wholesome and progressive reworking of the themes of The Lion King, this Finnish/Irish animation can’t however compete with the likes of Disney, Pixar, or even smaller outfits like Laika in terms of the look and feel of the animation – but it does a decent job of exploring traditional fairytale dilemmas from a more modern angle. In the third in a series of film adventures, Niko is a young adolescent flying reindeer, desperate to join the elite team that pulls Santa’s sleigh; he’s also a nepo baby, with dad Prancer depending on him to uphold the family rep. Niko is expecting to waltz right into basic training with the squad, but the one spot available turns out to be contested by an outsider called Stella, whose own father turns out to have generational beef to settle.
