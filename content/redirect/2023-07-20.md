title: S&P 500 tanks as leaders speak of successes amid party defeats
summary: © The Guardian—A trio of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/uk-byelection-results-labour-tories-selby-ainsty-uxbridge" title="">byelections</a> in England was good news for the main party leaders but not necessarily for their parties. Rishi Sunak can breathe a little easier for not losing three seats. The Tory party, however, will be worried about being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/byelection-results-paint-ominous-picture-tories-despite-uxbridge-win" title="">defeated</a> in bluest Britain. Sir Keir Starmer has shown he can win in a Conservative heartland, as New Labour did in 1997, overturning a 20,000-seat majority in North Yorkshire. However, his party’s failure to win in London raises doubts about its electoral strategy. Voters seem to be saying that the Conservative party deserves to lose at the next election, but the Labour party doesn’t – yet – deserve to win outright.
