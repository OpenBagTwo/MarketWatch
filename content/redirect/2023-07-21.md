title: Nikkei dives as Rory McIlroy takes long and winding Open road but needs leaders to falter
summary: © The Guardian—It feels like Rory McIlroy has been doing this to us for practically his whole career. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory and victory from defeat – like someone who gives you butterflies on a first date and then doesn’t text back, leaving us tossing and turning in our sleep; sweating, ponderous, infuriated.
