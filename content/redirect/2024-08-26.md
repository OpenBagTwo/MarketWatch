    © The Guardian—As with a lot of fathers and sons, I suspect, probably 50% or more of the conversations my father and I had were about sport, and most of them were about football. Like my grandfather, like myself, my father was a lifelong supporter of Huddersfield Town, and he often talked about the great Town sides and players of the past: Vic Metcalfe and Jimmy Glazzard, Denis Law and Ray Wilson, Jimmy Nicholson and Frank Worthington.
