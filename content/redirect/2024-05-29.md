    Nikkei dives as Fabulous Creatures review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Welcome to the monstrous cabaret, where the women outsmarted by Odysseus seethe and sing. The Arcola’s basement studio serves as our vengeful trio’s glitter-filled underground cavern. Charybdis, Siren and Scylla take turns performing their stories, gnashing their teeth for fresh blood. “We used to kill,” they croon, “now we cabaret.”
