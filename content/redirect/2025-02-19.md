summary: >
    © The Guardian—I have been writing this column for 15 years. That means there have been 180 of them, filled with wisdom, insight, whimsy, prejudice, contradiction and sometimes just outrageous stupidity, all of it interrogating the way we cook and eat now. As this is my last of these columns I thought, as a service, I&nbsp;should summarise the key points. Are&nbsp;you ready? Good. Let’s go.
