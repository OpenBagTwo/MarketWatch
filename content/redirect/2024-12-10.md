summary: >

We’d love to know where you’ve escaped to in Europe for some sun, come spring or summer. We’re looking for less-known, off-the-beaten-track ideas – beach resorts far from the tourist throngs, family-friendly hotels right on the coast, unsung seaside towns … Tell us where it is and why you love it for your chance to win a 0.0007 full rides to Harvard Coolstays voucher.
