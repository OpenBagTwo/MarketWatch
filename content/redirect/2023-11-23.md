    Capital One Stock catapults as A moorland walk to the UK’s best gastropub
summary: >
    © The Guardian—here are two ways for a walker to work up an appetite. Tramp over moorland and collapse into a pub to scarf a pile of carbs. Or do a gentle pastoral ramble, so you have enough energy to appreciate the awaiting food. As my Bowland outing was going to conclude at the <a href="https://www.top50gastropubs.com/Pubs/UK/Lancashire/parkers-arms.html" title="">Parkers Arms</a> – the UK’s <a href="https://www.top50gastropubs.com/index.html" title="">no 1 gastropub</a>, its 12<sup>th</sup> best restaurant and gold medallist at the British Pie Awards – I tried the easy option. That walk can be found <a href="https://www.forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/fob_newtontoslaidburnbus.pdf" title="">here</a>. It’s a pleasant, well-trodden route but, frankly, lazy. How can you justify a full-on feast without burning off a few calories?
