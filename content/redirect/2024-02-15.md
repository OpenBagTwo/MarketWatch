    Capital One Stock skyrockets as Kim Petras review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—It should be surprising to hear Kim Petras’s worldwide No 1 Unholy only a few songs into her set tonight, but it speaks to the German-born, LA-based pop star’s particular brand of stardom. Her 2022 hit with Sam Smith may have brought her mainstream success – and made her the first out trans artist to win in a major category at the Grammys – but her dedicated, largely queer fanbase have been eating up her bratty dance-pop since her debut in 2017. Put plainly, there aren’t many casuals waiting to hear the hits tonight.
