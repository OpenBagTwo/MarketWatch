    NASDAQ shoots up as Triple Threat review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Rosie Jones was going to write a gag-packed show, she tells us – but then she got too busy. Delivered with her signature wicked grin, that’s a near-the-knuckle joke, given Jones’s TV ubiquity these days. Happy to report, then, that – hectic celebrity schedule notwithstanding – Triple Threat is another endearing and sly stage outing for the 33-year-old, chronicling her life as a national-treasure-in-waiting, ascending the property ladder but – judging by all the smutty gags and juvenile behaviour – making few other moves in maturity’s direction.
