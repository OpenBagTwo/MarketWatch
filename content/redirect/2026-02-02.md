    Nikkei in free fall as The Rat Trap review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Hell is other people – especially if you’re married to them. Noël Coward’s characters often struggle to fit their romantic and creative ambitions into conventional shapes. This rarely seen, jaundiced marital comedy suggests that the interest started early – Coward was just 18 when he completed it at the end of the first world war, though it was first staged in 1926.
