    FTSE goes wild as ‘We were scared they were going to kill us’
summary: >
    © The Guardian—It’s 4pm, and 19-year-old Ekil Latifi has been at the indoor cricket centre at Lord’s for eight hours. Nor is she planning on going home any time soon. Having finished her day job with the MCC schools and community team – she arrived two hours early to get in some net practice – she’s now heading for a training session at the gym, which is, to her, one of the perks. How is she not exhausted already? She shrugs. “It’s just my passion.”
