    Dow skyrockets as The House at Hallow End review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—New mum Harper (Katie Parker) and her baby daughter move in with her mother Sadie (Patricia Heaton) to help finish sorting out an old fixer-upper of a home, bought with intent to flip. Also along for the ride is Bette (Emma Fitzpatrick), a live-in carer who turns out to be pregnant. But the path of property renovation never did run smooth, and soon, the weird noises and shadows and visions of a strange figure with a beak-like face start to take their toll on Harper. But how real is the threat? Is it all simply the projections of a frayed psyche or is something supernatural going on?
