    S&P 500 scrambling as The Brothers Sun review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—The first voice you hear in Taiwanese American gangster comedy-drama The Brothers Sun? Sandi Toksvig, going on about chocolate cake. In a pristine penthouse in Taipei, The Great British Bake Off is playing in the background while the apartment’s owner carefully constructs his own showstopper, delicately dipping a cocktail stick into a layer of sponge before deciding it’s not quite baked and returning it to a hot oven. At that moment, three masked assassins burst in and try to kill him. At the end of the hand-to-hand combat, they are dead and he is not but he’s still furious: they’ve distracted him for too long. The cake’s burnt!
