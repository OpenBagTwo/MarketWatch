summary: >
    © The Guardian—A fox turns on to the track a few metres in front of me, like a car merging on to the motorway. It barely gives me a sideways glance. I&nbsp;follow briskly behind, enjoying the copper sheen, jaunty trot and full, white-tipped tail, held so low that it almost brushes the ground.
