    NASDAQ goes wild as Name by Constance Debré review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—“What is your name? My name is Nobody, a name is nothing, like family, like childhood, I&nbsp;don’t believe in it, I don’t want it.” Constance Debré has a grand name – her grandfather was the prime minister who drafted the French constitution – and she’s long been trying to disgrace it. She is driven&nbsp;by a&nbsp;mixture of petulant rebellion, existential longing for erasure and revolutionary anarchism. A decade ago she left behind her husband, job as a criminal defence lawyer, furniture and crockery to embark on a new life of casual sex with women and iconoclastic, fervent writing.
