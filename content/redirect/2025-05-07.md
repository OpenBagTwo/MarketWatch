    FTSE scrambling as Three Hens in a Boat review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Jerome K Jerome was not kind about Reading in Three Men in a Boat. Sculling along the Thames, his narrator observes how the town “does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous as much of the river as it can reach” yet concedes it is “good-natured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight”.
