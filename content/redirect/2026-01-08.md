    NASDAQ plunges as Grok is undressing women and children. Don’t expect the US to take action
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Over the past year, Elon Musk has made a series of protocol changes to Grok, the proprietary AI chatbot of his company xAI, which runs prominently on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. Many of these changes have been geared to make the bot more amenable to producing pornography. In August 2025, Grok launched an image generator, branded as Grok Imagine, which featured a service geared toward creating nude, suggestive, or sexually explicit content, including computer-generated pornographic images of real women. The feature, which was quickly used to create naked images of celebrities like Taylor Swift, also allowed users to create brief videos, complete with animations and sounds.
