    FTSE scrambling as The Voyage Home by Pat Barker audiobook review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—This is the last book in Pat Barker’s Women of Troy trilogy, in which The Iliad is reimagined from the perspective of the women Homer consigned to the margins. It opens with the maid Ritsa and her mistress Cassandra boarding the Medusa, a “battered old sick bucket” bound for the Greek kingdom of Mycenae. Cassandra is the kidnapped Trojan seer and concubine of Agamemnon, the warrior king who is returning home after a decade of war. Having razed Troy, Agamemnon will be expecting a hero’s welcome, though there is uncertainty over how he will be received by his wife, Clytemnestra. Ten years have passed since he sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to the gods in exchange for safe passage to Troy. Will Clytemnestra have forgiven her husband or will she seek revenge?
