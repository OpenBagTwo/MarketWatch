    Nikkei catapults as ‘It blows my mind that people still don’t want to believe women’
summary: >
    © The Guardian—“Can you say I wafted in looking stunning?” asks Lou Sanders, dissolving into laughter before she’s even finished her sentence. She is joking, of course – the comedian isn’t actually desperate for a hyperbolically awed 2000s glossy magazine-style depiction of herself in print. It’s just that airing the silliest, cringiest, most wildly conceited response to any given situation – always coupled with a self-effacing acknowledgment of the ridiculousness of what she’s saying – is Sanders’ stock in trade.
