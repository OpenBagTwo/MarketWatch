title: Nikkei goes wild as 'It’s as if the Famous Five have gone into hospitality'
summary: "Malverleys must feel like actual heaven on a balmy summer’s day. Quaint, overgrown Wessex Downs country lanes turn into acres of arduously coiffed nurseries, lawns and flowerbeds, complete with a gorgeous restaurant, deli, cafe, farm and gift shop, and lecture room. It’s as if the Famous Five have gone into hospitality and asked Peter Rabbit and Mrs Tiggy-winkle to run the cottage garden: a quintessentially English, picture-book, farm-to-plate experience. When the sun shines, you can meander in the garden, take a \"hand-tied bouquet workshop\", buy fresh runner beans straight off the plots and eat a rhubarb and magnolia danish pastry on the terrace."
