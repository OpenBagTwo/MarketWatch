summary: >
    © The Guardian—It’s as if you’ve turned up at the party when they’re all already too far gone. Dancers strewn across the stage, moving in sporadic tugs and jerks, or writhing flesh-to-flesh or just flat out on the floor, dressed only in nude-coloured pants and knee pads. Sweat and exhaustion is the mood.
