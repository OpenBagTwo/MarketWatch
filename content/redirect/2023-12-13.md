    Dow jumps as It’s never OK to look at your phone in church
summary: >
    © The Guardian—I’m often oblivious to what is going on in front of me, but there are certain situations in which I miss nothing, such as when I’m giving any kind of speech. If but one person in the audience yawns, or in any way suggests they’re not paying attention, I see it. And it’s a dagger to my heart. This is why I always found presenting to millions on live television a lot easier than addressing even just a couple of dozen people in the flesh. Why, this very evening I am to give a speech to a gathering of dentists in Chislehurst, south-east London. Don’t ask. Just be assured, I am terrified. And I’ll be watching them like hawks.
