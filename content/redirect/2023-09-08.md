    Nikkei tumbles as Siouxsie review
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Is it the job of an icon to fulfil expectations or to toy with them? The return to London of Siouxsie Sioux, so often lumbered with the soubriquet “queen of the goths”, isn’t heralded by a symbolic release of bats but by four dancing girls in tiaras and spangly bikinis. A stand-up band play cabaret ragtime. This beautifully restored east London venue screams art deco glamour, not post-punk anomie.
