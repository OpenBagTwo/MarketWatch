    S&P 500 catapults as ‘So popular even its owner can’t get a table’
summary: >
    If anywhere can do fish properly, it is a restaurant with its own fishmongers, such as Fish Shop in the village of<a href="https://visitballater.com/"> Ballater</a>, to the east of the Cairngorms in Aberdeenshire. Simply the fact that you can see gloriously fresh Scottish day-boat fish in the adjoining shop window is reassuring. Friends of this column will know <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/14/the-oyster-club-birmingham-restaurant-review-grace-dent">my thoughts on speciality seafood restaurants</a>, and I am weary of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/20/goddard-and-gibbs-london-e1-grace-dent-restaurant-review">fishy tales dreamed up by marketeers</a>, promising “locally sourced” swimming things cooked by allegedly highly trained <em>poissoniers</em>. I’ll translate: “We will lug some Honduran prawns out of the deep-freeze and serve them with mayo mixed with ketchup. Please overlook the decor, which comprises shelfloads of nautical tat from Dunelm.”
