summary: >
    For a while it was a secret that only the A-listers were in on. Now, however, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/09/i-miss-eating-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-food-repulsive">Ozempic</a> – the diabetes drug that is being used off-label as an appetite suppressant – is everywhere. Ads for the medication are ubiquitous on US TV screens, videos of people documenting their Ozempic use are <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ozempic">all over TikTok</a>, and people like Elon Musk are <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518222204097413122?lang=en">loudly singing</a> its praises. So many people are now popping Ozempic, Wegovy and other appetite-suppressing medications, that the effect is reportedly being felt in grocery aisles across America.
