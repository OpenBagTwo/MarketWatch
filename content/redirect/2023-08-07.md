title: S&P 500 goes wild as Lauren James made a stupid mistake
summary: © The Guardian—Lauren James doesn’t need your targeted message. She doesn’t need your snide Instagram comment, Twitter bullying or below-the-line condemnation. No one will be able to beat up James more than she will be doing to herself, so why pile on? Maybe this article shouldn’t exist either; perhaps picking over the bones of the incident feels unnecessary. Punishment will be dealt – shouldn’t we just move on? Maybe. Except there are broader points to be made about what level of criticism is appropriate in the women’s game, and the men’s game for that matter, and where the line lies between analysis, abuse and bullying.
