title: FTSE shoots up as Women’s World Cup to kick off, Burney’s plea for voice, Australian wickets fall in Ashes
summary: Morning everyone. The waiting is finally over. Australia will tonight kickoff the Women’s World Cup in their first group match against Ireland in front of a sellout crowd at Sydney’s Accor Stadium. Expectation is high-going-on-stratospheric for the next few weeks as the Matildas bid to become world champions. We’ve got unrivalled coverage building up to the match. In a campaign of a different sort, Linda Burney has a stark warning for Australians on the voice, Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to appear, and Australia battle to 299-8 after being inserted at Old Trafford.
