    S&P 500 tanks as Sayan Bose’s best phone picture
summary: >
    © The Guardian—Sayan Bose had travelled two hours from his home in Kolkata, India, for a day of documentary photography in Sangrampur, West Bengal. “I was roaming around the village, capturing the local people’s lifestyle, asking about their daily lives and jobs and struggles,” Bose says. “I got talking to a 17-year-old called Ariful Alam. He was a&nbsp;farmer at a large sunflower garden. He was youthful and fun-loving, and agreed to pose in the field for me.”
