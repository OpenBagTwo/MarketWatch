This is a silly little project I knocked out in a day based on [this webcomic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/markets)
by Zach Weinersmith. All content is sourced from The Guardian.

The code to generate this website is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/MarketWatch) and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

If you have questions or concerns, please [open an issue via GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/MarketWatch/issues).
